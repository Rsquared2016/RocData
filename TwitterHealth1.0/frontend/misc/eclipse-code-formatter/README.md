# Java code formatter

* Is defined in twitterhealth-frontend-eclipse-java-code.xml
* Tabs policy has been changed to Spaces only with indentation size = 4 (this change is already included in the XML).
* Import the XML file into eclipse: Window->Preferences->Java->Code style->Formatter->Import
* Then go to Window->Preferences->General->Editors->Text Editors and check "Insert spaces for tabs" ("Show line numbers" is also handy).
