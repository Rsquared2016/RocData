===========================

We should update readme for better know hows.

The backend daemon runs automatically after reboot (see `crontab -l` for explanation of what happens).
It is safe to log-off after the deamon is running, as we are using nohup.
The status of the backend can be checked with: backend/check_status.sh

To compile and run the frontend:
install maven, Java 1.6+
$ cd TwitterHealth/frontend
$ mvn clean install
make sure port 8080 is unoccupied
$ sh target/bin/webapp
browse to localhost:8080

Optionally, you can redirect port 80 to 8080 on your local machine
gnu/linux:
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

mac:
ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from any to any 80 in
